# Stratego MPC example
Minimal examples running UPPAAL Stratego as a part of model predictive control MPC loop using [`strategoutil`](https://github.com/mihsamusev/strategoutil.git).

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Overview examples
The following examples are included at the moment:
- Room heating
- Traffic light

## Room heating
This example describes a single room being heated based on _Online and Compositional Learning of Controllers with Application to Floor Heating_ ([link to paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_14)).

The tast of the MPC controller is to decide each 15 minutes whether the heather in a room should be on or off to keep the room temperature as close as possible to the desired room temperature.

This example uses the basic functionality of the [`strategoutil`](https://github.com/mihsamusev/strategoutil.git) library. To run the example use `RoomHeating_online_control.py` script, the only thing you need to customize is the path to UPPAAL Stratego `verifyta` stored in `verifytaCommand` variable (line 26). 

### Files included
To accomodate shown MPC loop, the project consists of couple of files:

- `*.xml` template file describing UPPAAL model where changing variables commented out with known tags. In the file `heatedroom-online` variable values are substitued by tags that are recognized by the python MPC library.
- `RoomHeating_online_control.py` that uses and showcases the MPC control loop implemented with the [`strategoutil`](https://github.com/mihsamusev/strategoutil.git) library.
- `verifyta_config.yaml` configuration file with `verifyta` arguments. In this example the same arguments are used as originally in the paper.
- `model_config.yaml` configuration file with the tag variables and their initial values.
- `*.q` file specifying Stratego query (generated by the MPC library).

## Traffic light example
This example describes a toy example traffic control of one way road intersections based on _Eriksen et al., 2020, Controlling Signalized Intersections using Machine Learning_ ([link to paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trpro.2020.08.127)).

Corresponding UPPAAL stratego model is found in `uppaal/model.xml`. The task of the MPC control loop iteratively to re-build the model with updated/measured queue lengths `S` and `E`, and calculate optimal control strategy up to horizon. This re-building happends by using `uppaal/model_template.xml` where important variables are commented out with a specific patterns/tags known to the user. [`strategoutil`](https://github.com/mihsamusev/strategoutil.git) then allows to replace those tags with values. For simplicity of the example, measureable disturbances such as vehicle inflow/outflow rates `r` are not inserted back into the model and stay costant.

To run the example use `example.py` script, the only thing you need to customize is the path to UPPAAL Stratego `verifyta` stored in `VERIFYTA_PATH` variable.

To accomodate shown MPC loop, the project consists of couple of files:

- `*.xml` template file describing UPPAAL model where changing variables commented out with known tags. Folder `uppaal/` contains original `model.xml`, and `model_template.xml` where variables are substitued by tags.
- `model_interface.py` that leverages `StrategoController` class and functions of `strategoutil` to create the interface to exclusively interact with `model_template.xml`.
- `example.py` that puts it all together and showcases the MPC control loop
- [optional] `*.yaml` configuration file with `verifyta` arguments, in the example default arguments are used
- [optional] `*.q` file specifying Stratego query, in the example query inside `model_template.xml` will be used


## Some inserting tricks
Currently, the MPC library looks for the tags of form `//TAG_` followed by the variable name.
Maybe its not a good idea to crete tags that contain `<>` characters, since in `*.xml` file they are written as `&lt;` or `&lt;`, which might lead to confusion. A simplest alternative is just to add `//TAG_` in front of your variable name.
